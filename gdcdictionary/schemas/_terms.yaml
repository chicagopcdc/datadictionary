    The cytotoxicity of MTIC is due primarily to methylation of DNA at the O6 and
    N7 positions of guanine, resulting in inhibition of DNA replication. Unlike dacarbazine,
    which is metabolized to MITC only in the liver, temozolomide is metabolized to
    MITC at all sites. Temozolomide is administered orally and penetrates well into

    to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich
    sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as
    well as DNA-protein cross-links.  These carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects
    result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.  This agent possesses tumoricidal
    activity similar to that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable
    and less toxic. (NCI04)

  description: The hydrochloride salt of doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic

    intercalates between base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA replication
    and ultimately inhibiting protein synthesis. Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits
    topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA
    linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of
    the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen
    free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell
    membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes to the
    toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and cutaneous vascular
    effects.

  description: A liposomal formulation containing a muramyl dipeptide (MDP) analogue
    with potential immunomodulatory and antineoplastic activities. Muramyl tripeptide
    phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PE), a derivative of the mycobacterial cell wall
    component MDP, activates both monocytes and macrophages. Activated macrophages
    secrete cytokines and induce the recruitment and activation of other immune cells,
    which may result in indirect tumoricidal effects. Liposomal encapsulation of MTP-PE
    prolongs its half-life and enhances tissue targeting.

    crystals in the bone matrix, slowing their dissolution and inhibiting the formation
    and aggregation of these crystals. This agent also inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate
    synthase, an enzyme involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme
    prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids, donor substrates of farnesylation
    and geranylgeranylation during the post-translational modification of small GTPase
    signalling proteins, which are important in the process of osteoclast turnover.
    Decreased bone turnover and stabilization of the bone matrix contribute to the
    analgesic effect of zoledronic acid with respect to painful osteoblastic lesions.
    The agent also reduces serum calcium concentrations associated with hypercalcemia.

  description: A synthetic hydroxamic acid derivative with antineoplastic activity.
    Vorinostat, a second generation polar-planar compound, binds to the catalytic
    domain of the histone deacetylases (HDACs). This allows the hydroxamic moiety
    to chelate zinc ion located in the catalytic pockets of HDAC, thereby inhibiting
    deacetylation and leading to an accumulation of both hyperacetylated histones
    and transcription factors. Hyperacetylation of histone proteins results in the
    upregulation of the cyclin-dependant kinase p21, followed by G1 arrest. Hyperacetylation
    of non-histone proteins such as tumor suppressor p53, alpha tubulin, and heat-shock
    protein 90 produces additional anti-proliferative effects. This agent also induces
    apoptosis and sensitizes tumor cells to cell death processes. Vorinostat crosses
    the blood-brain barrier.

    Hydrocortisone sodium succinate is chemically similar to the endogenous hormone
    that stimulates anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities, in addition
    to exhibiting minor mineralocorticoid effects. This agent binds to intracellular
    glucocorticoid receptors and is translocated into the nucleus, where it initiates
    the transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive genes, such as various cytokines
    and lipocortins. Lipocortins inhibit phospholipase A2, thereby blocking the release
    of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and preventing the synthesis of
    prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both potent mediators of inflammation.

    reversibly inhibits the 26S proteasome, a large protease complex that degrades
    ubiquinated proteins. By blocking the targeted proteolysis normally performed
    by the proteasome, bortezomib disrupts various cell signaling pathways, leading
    to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis. Specifically,
    the agent inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a protein that is constitutively
    activated in some cancers, thereby interfering with NF-kappaB-mediated cell survival,
    tumor growth, and angiogenesis. In vivo, bortezomib delays tumor growth and enhances
    the cytotoxic effects of radiation and chemotherapy.

    properties. The IFNs produced by virus-stimulated leukocytes (leukocyte IFNs)
    are predominantly of the alpha type. Those produced by lymphoblastoid cells are
    about 90% alpha and 10% beta. Induced fibroblasts produce mainly or exclusively
    the beta type. The alpha- and beta-IFNs differ widely in amino acid sequence.
    The gamma or immune IFNs, which are produced by T lymphocytes in response to mitogens
    or to antigens to which they are sensitized, are acid-labile and serologically
    distinct from alpha- and beta-IFNs. (from OMIM 147570)'

    interact with other genes or environmental factors to induce cancer. Research
    may involve clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory studies of persons, families,

    by cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors with patches of hyperpigmentation. The hyperpigmented
    skin areas, are present from birth and found anywhere on the body surface.  They
    can vary markedly in size and color.  The dark brown areas are called cafe-au-lait
    spots. The multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors are nerve sheath tumors,
    called neurofibromas.  They can develop anywhere along the peripheral nerve fibers.
    Neurofibromas can become quite large, causing a major disfigurement, eroding bone,
    and compressing various peripheral nerve structures.  Type 1 neurofibromatosis
    has dominant inheritance, with a gene locus on the proximal long arm of chromosome
    17.

    They can occur throughout the colon, but they tend to concentrate in the rectum
    and sigmoid colon. The colorectal adenomas are detected during endoscopic examination
    between the age of 10 and 20 years. The adenomas increase in size and numbers

    The mean age of development of adenocarcinoma is about 40 years. Signs include
    rectal bleeding and mucousy diarrhea.

  description: An anthracycline antibiotic with antineoplastic activity. Doxorubicin,

    congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin intercalates between base pairs in the DNA
    helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and ultimately inhibiting protein synthesis.
    Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased
    and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and
    subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand
    breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity
    secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen

    disease on both sides of the diaphragm and stage IV patients once again have disseminated
    disease. Consideration of involvement of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow are
    also considered in this system. Finally, the stage is subdivided into categories
    of A and B depending on the presence of symptoms of itching, weight loss, fever,
    and night sweats. Those having symptoms receive the designation "B" and have a
