UUID:
  description: A 128-bit identifier. Depending on the mechanism used to generate it,
    it is either guaranteed to be different from all other UUIDs/GUIDs generated until
    3400 AD or extremely likely to be different. Its relatively small size lends itself
    well to sorting, ordering, and hashing of all sorts, storing in databases, simple
    allocation, and ease of programming in general.
