UUID:
  description: A 128-bit identifier. Depending on the mechanism used to generate it,
    it is either guaranteed to be different from all other UUIDs/GUIDs generated until

    well to sorting, ordering, and hashing of all sorts, storing in databases, simple
    allocation, and ease of programming in general.

    antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gilteritinib binds to and inhibits
    both the wild-type and mutated forms of FLT3, AXL, ALK and LTK. This may result
    in an inhibition of FLT3-, AXL-, ALK-, and LTK-mediated signal transduction pathways
    and reduced proliferation in cancer cells that overexpress these RTKs. FLT3, AXL,
    ALK, and LTK, which are overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancer cell types,
    play key roles in tumor cell growth and survival.

    treatment for cancer. Immature circulating blood cells, similar to stem cells
    in the bone marrow, are removed before treatment. The cells are then given to
    the patient after treatment to help the bone marrow recover and continue producing
    healthy blood cells. Transplantation may be autologous (the patient's own blood

  description: A synthetic imidazole bisphosphonate analog of pyrophosphate with anti-bone-resorption
    activity. A third-generation bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid binds to hydroxyapatite
    crystals in the bone matrix, slowing their dissolution and inhibiting the formation
    and aggregation of these crystals. This agent also inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate
    synthase, an enzyme involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme
    prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids, donor substrates of farnesylation
    and geranylgeranylation during the post-translational modification of small GTPase
    signalling proteins, which are important in the process of osteoclast turnover.
    Decreased bone turnover and stabilization of the bone matrix contribute to the
    analgesic effect of zoledronic acid with respect to painful osteoblastic lesions.
    The agent also reduces serum calcium concentrations associated with hypercalcemia.

  description: A synthetic hydroxamic acid derivative with antineoplastic activity.
    Vorinostat, a second generation polar-planar compound, binds to the catalytic
    domain of the histone deacetylases (HDACs). This allows the hydroxamic moiety
    to chelate zinc ion located in the catalytic pockets of HDAC, thereby inhibiting
    deacetylation and leading to an accumulation of both hyperacetylated histones
    and transcription factors. Hyperacetylation of histone proteins results in the
    upregulation of the cyclin-dependant kinase p21, followed by G1 arrest. Hyperacetylation
    of non-histone proteins such as tumor suppressor p53, alpha tubulin, and heat-shock
    protein 90 produces additional anti-proliferative effects. This agent also induces
    apoptosis and sensitizes tumor cells to cell death processes. Vorinostat crosses
    the blood-brain barrier.

    reversibly inhibits the 26S proteasome, a large protease complex that degrades
    ubiquinated proteins. By blocking the targeted proteolysis normally performed
    by the proteasome, bortezomib disrupts various cell signaling pathways, leading
    to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis. Specifically,
    the agent inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a protein that is constitutively
    activated in some cancers, thereby interfering with NF-kappaB-mediated cell survival,
    tumor growth, and angiogenesis. In vivo, bortezomib delays tumor growth and enhances
    the cytotoxic effects of radiation and chemotherapy.

    about 90% alpha and 10% beta. Induced fibroblasts produce mainly or exclusively
    the beta type. The alpha- and beta-IFNs differ widely in amino acid sequence.
    The gamma or immune IFNs, which are produced by T lymphocytes in response to mitogens
    or to antigens to which they are sensitized, are acid-labile and serologically
    distinct from alpha- and beta-IFNs. (from OMIM 147570)'

    3 teratomas are composed exclusively of immature tissues. The prognosis depends

  description: An anthracycline antibiotic with antineoplastic activity. Doxorubicin,

    congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin intercalates between base pairs in the DNA
    helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and ultimately inhibiting protein synthesis.
    Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased
    and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and
    subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand
    breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity
    secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen
    free radicals also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics,

  description: A carcinoma originating in the lung. Lung carcinomas usually arise
    from the epithelium that lines the bronchial tree (bronchogenic carcinomas), and
    are classified as small cell or non-small cell carcinomas. Non-small cell lung
    carcinomas are usually adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, or large cell
    carcinomas. Metastatic carcinomas to the lung are also common, and can be difficult
    to distinguish from primary tumors.

    SGN-30 to the cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a valine-citrulline
